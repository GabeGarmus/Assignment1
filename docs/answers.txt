A) On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
 
B) 4 commits using: git shortlog

C) Thu Jan 10 16:45:38 2019  command: git log .gitignore

 D) Branching allows us to merge later,
	it also allows to switch back to previous code
	 without having to revert all the work

  E) git log shows commit logs, while git status displayes working tree status
  F) git log --follow -p Weapon.h
G) git log--grep="file"
H)
	 inheritance allows to branch off from a single object to more
	 specific objects using the characteristics from its superclass

	 Polymorphism is ability to call a function name and it'll return the
	 correct info based on the paramaters passed in.

	 Encapsulation is having private data that can only be manipulated
	 and obtained thru public functions

I) The main difference between Integration Manager workflow and Dictator and
	Lieutenats workflow is that in the Integration Manager the developers
	have a private repository, and that they push to a single manager
	instead of assigned lieutenant.

J) A team of 100 developers would benefit from the Dictator and Lietenatns
	workflow because there would be a set amount of leutenants that
	merge changes, and solve the developer issues, rather than each
	developer pushing to a single giant cluster of files.

5)
    The RoleGame is using Polymorphism because no matter what weapon we pass in it
    returns the corresponding results. For example all we have to pass in is the
    weapon name and the program will figure out the corresponding hit function.
